The rooms are not too big but very nicely decorated and clean, and certainly not noisy. The breakfast had a wide choice of bread, toppings and yoghurt. And this was also always refilled. When paying there was a small problem that was not with the hotel, but this was solved professionally and with a smile. This was our second visit to this hotel but certainly not the last time.",

It turned out that they had tried to fish the bacon out. Staff also did not know how many rounds we were going for, while this had been arranged in advance. This is how it also went wrong with the people who did not want fish.",

Neat service by young people under the supervision of an experienced lady. For the detail they do not have Coca Cola but Pepsi. Furthermore neat and clean good and varied music in the background certainly not disturbing. Well filled lunch menu with something for everyone. We had the home burger and the strips of tenderloin. Both very tasty the tenderloin with a tasty sauce and the burger still a tiny bit pink but cooked and juicy. The hand cut fries nice yellow gold and not golden yellow. Definitely recommended and we will definitely go back even if the sun is not shining because it also looks neat authentic inside. Recommended",

Despite the enormous crowds (on Saturday it was completely full) friendly, fast and efficient service. Breakfast was - considering the price of E 13.50 - a bit disappointing. If it had been included in the room price we would have been happy with it. Now it was expensive considering the offer. Room 10 is small. No view through the skylight. However, the room and shower room were modern and well cleaned. The wifi is of excellent quality; you rarely come across that in such a large building. A ten with a pencil for the bed reading lamps! Not seen before on our many wanderings. The bottle of mineral water that we found in the room was friendly. We found the beds too hard. We missed the coffee and tea facilities that are almost always present in the small room. The friendly staff and the delicious food from the restaurant will remain with us from our stay at Thuis!",

The menu has changed a bit since our last visit. The portions have become a bit bigger in my opinion. Excellent of course! The service (recording) is very friendly and fast. Due to the large number of choices, it seems like hell to take the order with a mobile phone. To be honest, it didn't always go well, but not worth commenting on. Extra credit for the \"flank steak\", the steak and of course the bitterballen (which fortunately remained). The potato soup is missed. In my opinion, there are relatively many \"cheesy\" dishes on the new menu. It should be clear that I am not a cheese lover. I understand that the concept means that many dishes are prepared in advance and that \"preferably without cheese, no fish\" is very difficult to achieve. The above is intended as positive input, certainly not as criticism. Team Thuis thank you very much for a nice evening with delicious dishes. Keep up the good work, I would like to come again.",

On Saturday evening when we arrived at half past seven it was fully booked, good that we had made a reservation in advance. We (two couples) chose the Tapas menu. A very wide choice of all kinds of small dishes. Fish, Meat and Vegetarian. The concept leads in some restaurants to a focus on drinks and slow service. That is not the case at Thuis. All the service staff is super friendly, quick and helpful. Not pushy with drinks but present exactly on time when the glasses are empty. That is how it should be. The small dishes are, where possible, already prepared so that the time between ordering and serving can be called short. You order one dish at a time but get two, so coordination with your table companions is useful. A selection of the starters: spicy potato soup, beef croquettes (truly phenomenal) chicken drumsticks, Spanish meat platter and much more. Among the main courses, the pork tenderloin (hopefully not the \"culinary/ham-like\" variant?) was a bit of a disappointment in terms of quality, steak and other dishes were perfect. From the dessert menu, you order three at a time, which are also served at once. Neatly presented and tastes great. Definitely recommended, we will definitely drive to Dinteloord again for it.",

The menu has changed a bit since our last visit. The portions have become a bit bigger in my opinion. Excellent of course! The service (recording) is very friendly and fast. Due to the large number of choices, it seems like hell to take the order with a mobile phone. To be honest, it didn't always go well, but not worth commenting on. Extra credit for the \"flank steak\", the steak and of course the bitterballen (which fortunately remained). The potato soup is missed. In my opinion, there are relatively many \"cheesy\" dishes on the new menu. It should be clear that I am not a cheese lover. I understand that the concept means that many dishes are prepared in advance and that \"preferably without cheese, no fish\" is very difficult to achieve. The above is intended as positive input, certainly not as criticism. Team Thuis thank you very much for a nice evening with delicious dishes. Keep up the good work, I would like to come again.",

On Saturday evening when we arrived at half past seven it was fully booked, good that we had made a reservation in advance. We (two couples) chose the Tapas menu. A very wide choice of all kinds of small dishes. Fish, Meat and Vegetarian. The concept leads in some restaurants to a focus on drinks and slow service. That is not the case at Thuis. All the service staff is super friendly, quick and helpful. Not pushy with drinks but present exactly on time when the glasses are empty. That is how it should be. The small dishes are, where possible, already prepared so that the time between ordering and serving can be called short. You order one dish at a time but get two, so coordination with your table companions is useful. A selection of the starters: spicy potato soup, beef croquettes (truly phenomenal) chicken drumsticks, Spanish meat platter and much more. Among the main courses, the pork tenderloin (hopefully not the \"culinary/ham-like\" variant?) was a bit of a disappointment in terms of quality, steak and other dishes were perfect. From the dessert menu, you order three at a time, which are also served at once. Neatly presented and tastes great. Definitely recommended, we will definitely drive to Dinteloord again for it.",

For example, service is rendered at the table and the order is not placed on a side table. Besides the staff is too close. In any case, not one and a half meters away. Though Corona registration is compulsory. Lunch tastes great and is reasonably priced. Nevertheless, the order is not correctly executed. The ordered omelette with salmon suddenly becomes an omelette with cheese. The staff does not come to the table to take the order or to pay - upon request. Also, the young staff does not pass the wrong omelette to the kitchen. The heat and many guests may be affecting the staff. The beautiful terrace is located on a fairly busy road.
